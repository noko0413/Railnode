## What is Railnode?

Railnode is a backend tool designed to help developers create data-driven apps quickly. It uses a structure that automatically builds parts of an app’s backend, so developers don’t have to write everything from scratch. While this might sound technical, it means apps get ready faster and work more reliably.

You don’t need to know how to code to understand this guide. It will help you get Railnode on your computer and running smoothly.

## 🚀 Starting Railnode for the First Time

After installation, you can start the Railnode backend with a few simple steps. This part runs the program that creates the API (a way for apps to talk to data).

**Step 1: Open the Railnode Application**

- You’ll see an icon added to your desktop or start menu.
- Double-click it to launch Railnode.

**Step 2: Open the Program Interface**

Railnode offers a simple window where you can set up your backend models. If the interface is new, don’t worry. It guides you step-by-step to create data tables and manage entries.

**Step 3: Explore Sample Data**

Railnode includes example models to help new users. Load these samples from the menu. Try adding or removing data to see how it works.

## 🛠 How Railnode Works Behind the Scenes

The app uses something called Express and TypeScript, but you don’t need to know these details to use it.

Here’s what it does for you:

- **Auto-Creation of API:** When you define your data structure, Railnode creates the routes or paths other apps use to send and get data.
- **CRUD Operations:** This means you can Create, Read, Update, and Delete data easily.
- **Convention-Driven:** By using standard styles, Railnode limits how much you have to configure. It chooses the right settings for you.
- **Schema-Defined Models:** You tell Railnode your data types and rules once. It builds the backend accordingly.

This makes adding more data tables or changing them easy, without coding every single part.

## 🖥 Using Railnode Day-to-Day

If you want to add more data types or update your app backend without programming, Railnode helps here.

- Open the app.
- Use the built-in editor to change your data models.
- Save your changes.
- Railnode updates the API instantly, so your app or client software sees the changes right away.

No complicated software or developer help is needed once installed.

---

## 🔍 Testing the API

Railnode creates what is called a REST API. It lets other programs ask your data questions or add new information with simple commands.

To test, you can use browser tools or apps made for testing APIs like Postman (free and easy to use).

For example:

- Use the address shown by Railnode on your computer, like `http://localhost:3000/api/yourmodel`.
- Go to this address in your browser to see the data.
- Try adding a new entry via the app interface or an API test tool.

## 📜 Notes on Security and Access

Because Railnode opens connections on your computer, it is important to:

- Only open it on your private network.
- Avoid sharing it with strangers unless you set up passwords or keys (advanced users can learn this later).
- Keep your software up to date by visiting the release page regularly.
